# Development Modes

Magic Defense Arena includes development modes to facilitate faster testing and debugging. This document outlines the available development features.

## Quick Entry Mode

For faster development, the game can be configured to skip the main menu and squad selection screens, starting directly at level 1 with a random squad. This is controlled by the `DEV_MODE` constant in App.tsx:

```tsx
// DEV_MODE controls whether to skip to gameplay
const DEV_MODE = true;
```

When DEV_MODE is enabled:
- The game starts directly in battle mode
- A random squad is automatically generated
- Characters are auto-placed on the battlefield
- Quick reset buttons are available during gameplay and after game over/victory screens

## Development Controls

The following development controls are available during gameplay when DEV_MODE is enabled:

- **Quick Reset Button**: Located in the top-right corner, restarts the game with a new random squad
- **Auto-placement**: Characters are automatically placed near the path for quick testing
- **Increased Starting Resources**: More coins are provided for testing purposes

## Auto-Placement Logic

The auto-placement system:
1. Identifies valid positions adjacent to the enemy path
2. Randomly selects positions for up to 4 characters
3. Handles placement and reserve updating

## Logging

Development mode includes enhanced logging:
- Squad size and composition
- Level initialization
- Auto-placement results
- Game events (waves, defeats, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Set `DEV_MODE = true` in App.tsx
2. Launch the game to immediately start the first level
3. Use the Quick Reset button to try different random squads
4. Set `DEV_MODE = false` to return to normal game flow

## Testing Specific Configurations

To test specific character configurations:
1. Keep DEV_MODE enabled
2. In App.tsx, modify the `mockCharacters` array to test specific character types
3. Adjust the `generateRandomSquad` function parameters as needed
