# Level Design

The tower defense game features carefully designed levels that progressively introduce game mechanics and challenge players' strategic thinking, with Level 1 documented in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md).

## Level 1: Constructor Defense

### Map Layout

Level 1 features an H-shaped layout:
- Base located in the center-top
- Builder starts in center-bottom
- Enemies spawn from left and right sides
- Initial towers pre-positioned at bottom entrance
- Narrow corridors force strategic structure placement

### Gameplay Phases

The level progresses through distinct phases:

1. **Tutorial Phase** (0-60 seconds):
   - Player explores map and mechanics
   - No enemy activity
   - UI provides guidance on controls and objectives

2. **First Wave** (60-120 seconds):
   - 4 goblins attack from left entrance
   - Teaches basic defense concepts
   - Winnable with minimal strategy

3. **Strategic Interval** (120-150 seconds):
   - Resource collection period
   - Planning for dual-front attack
   - Random resource crystal appears

4. **Second Wave** (150-240 seconds):
   - Simultaneous attacks (5 goblins left, 3 right)
   - Tests player's ability to manage multiple threats
   - Requires prioritization decisions

5. **Adaptation Phase** (240-270 seconds):
   - Assessment and recovery period
   - Repair damaged structures
   - Strengthen defenses for final wave

6. **Final Wave** (270-360 seconds):
   - Complex 3-part attack (goblins, carriers, ogre)
   - Ogre mini-boss targets weakest defenses
   - Tests all learned mechanics

### Critical Design Elements

1. **Strategic Zones**:
   - **Junction Points**: Where corridors meet (optimal tower placement)
   - **Choke Points**: Narrow passages (good for walls)
   - **Entry Points**: Where enemies spawn (require heavy defense)
   - **Base Perimeter**: Final defense line around the central base

2. **Visual Communication**:
   - Color-coding indicates structure types
   - Base highlighted in red to emphasize protection target
   - Entry points marked with visual indicators
   - Path visibility helps with strategic planning

3. **Progression Curve**:
   - Difficulty increases progressively
   - Each wave introduces new challenges
   - Resources scale with increasing threats
   - Final wave combines all previously introduced elements

## Level Design Principles

The following principles guide all level designs:

1. **Clear Objectives**:
   - Protect the base
   - Defeat all enemy waves
   - Secondary objectives (e.g., efficiency, minimal damage)

2. **Multiple Valid Strategies**:
   - Wall-heavy defensive approach
   - Tower-focused offensive approach
   - Balanced hybrid strategies
   - Different resource allocation options

3. **Meaningful Decisions**:
   - Resource prioritization (what to build first)
   - Placement decisions (where to build)
   - Movement priorities (where to position the builder)
   - Repair vs. rebuild choices

4. **Learning Through Play**:
   - Mechanics introduced progressively
   - Early failures are recoverable
   - Tutorial elements integrated into gameplay
   - Increasing challenge matches skill development

## Map Implementation

The map is implemented using:
- Tiled map editor format (JSON)
- Tileset with terrain and obstacle tiles
- Collision layers for pathfinding and placement restrictions
- Object layers for spawn points, paths, and other special elements

## Enemy Path Generation

Enemy paths are generated through:
1. Predefined paths in the map data
2. Dynamic pathfinding around player-placed obstacles
3. Path prioritization based on shortest route to base
4. Path recalculation when blocked by new structures
