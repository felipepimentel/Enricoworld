# Builder Character

The Builder is the player-controlled character that constructs and repairs defensive structures, implemented in [src/game/objects/Builder.ts](mdc:src/game/objects/Builder.ts).

## Core Capabilities

1. **Movement**:
   - Controlled with arrow keys
   - Movement speed: 200 units per second
   - Can move freely around the map
   - Collides with obstacles and structures

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Starts with 150 resources (as specified in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md))
   - Collects resources from defeated enemies
   - Collects resource crystals that appear randomly
   - Spends resources to build structures

3. **Structure Building**:
   - Can select structure types (1: Wall, 2: Tower, 3: Trap)
   - Preview shows where structure will be placed
   - Building only possible within range of the builder (~100 units)
   - Building animation plays when placing structures

4. **Repairs**:
   - Can repair damaged structures
   - Repair costs resources (typically less than building new)
   - Repair animation plays during process
   - Structures must be fully repaired before upgrading

## Builder UI Elements

1. **Hammer Tool**:
   - Visual indicator when in building/repair mode
   - Appears above the builder character
   - Animates during build/repair actions

2. **Build Preview**:
   - Shows selected structure type at cursor position
   - Changes color based on valid/invalid placement
   - Shows range indicators for towers

3. **Resource Counter**:
   - Displays current resource amount
   - Updates in real-time as resources change
   - Visually indicates when resources are insufficient

## Builder Gameplay Loop

During each wave sequence in the level:

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Build initial defenses using starting resources
   - Plan strategic structure placement based on map layout

2. **Active Wave Phase**:
   - Rush to problem areas to build emergency defenses
   - Repair damaged structures under attack
   - Prioritize critical defensive positions

3. **Post-Wave Phase**:
   - Collect dropped resources from defeated enemies
   - Strengthen weak points in defense
   - Upgrade existing structures for future waves

## Strategic Movement

The builder's positioning is critical:
1. Must travel between multiple attack fronts in later waves
2. Repair priority determines movement paths
3. Resource collection requires visiting drop locations
4. Building placement requires proximity to the target location

## Level 1 Builder Strategy

As outlined in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md):

1. **Initial Setup** (0-60 seconds):
   - Analyze the H-shaped map layout
   - Plan defensive structure placement
   - Note pre-positioned towers at the south entrance

2. **First Wave Response** (60-120 seconds):
   - Quickly build 1-2 walls/towers in the left corridor
   - Position to intercept the first goblin wave

3. **Multi-Front Defense** (150-240 seconds):
   - Split attention between both left and right corridors
   - Make tactical decisions about which side to prioritize
   - Use walls to temporarily block one path while defending another

4. **Final Wave Tactics** (270-360 seconds):
   - Focus on tracking and countering the ogre mini-boss
   - Rapidly repair structures damaged by the ogre
   - Maintain defensive coverage on both entry points

The builder's movement efficiency and decision-making under pressure are key factors in successfully completing the level.
