# Asset Management

Magic Defense Arena requires proper management of various game assets. Follow these guidelines for consistent asset handling.

## Asset Organization

```
src/assets/
├── sprites/
│   ├── characters/     # Player characters by type
│   ├── enemies/        # Enemy sprites by type
│   ├── environment/    # Maps, tiles, backgrounds
│   ├── ui/             # UI elements, buttons, icons
│   └── effects/        # Visual effects, animations
├── audio/
│   ├── music/          # Background music tracks
│   ├── sfx/            # Sound effects
│   └── voice/          # Voice lines (if applicable)
└── data/
    ├── levels/         # Level definitions
    ├── characters/     # Character stats and properties
    └── waves/          # Wave definitions
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all filenames
- Group assets by type, then by category
- Include dimensions in image asset names when appropriate
- Use consistent prefixes for asset types

Examples:
- `character-fire-level1.png`
- `enemy-brute-walk.png`
- `ui-button-green.png`
- `sfx-explosion-small.mp3`

## Asset Loading

- Load assets in the PreloadScene
- Use asset packs for organized loading
- Implement loading progress bar
- Consider dynamic loading for large assets

## Optimization

- Compress images appropriately (PNG for transparency, JPG for backgrounds)
- Create sprite atlases for animations and related sprites
- Optimize audio files (use MP3 or OGG with appropriate bitrates)
- Resize images to match game requirements
- Use texture compression when supported

## Animation Management

- Create consistent animation configurations
- Define animations in a central location
- Use animation keys with descriptive names
- Share animations between similar entities when possible

## Best Practices

1. **Version Control**: Keep assets in version control with the code
2. **Documentation**: Document each asset's purpose and usage
3. **Fallbacks**: Provide fallbacks for missing or loading assets
4. **References**: Track where each asset is used in the game
5. **License Tracking**: Document the license/source of each asset

## Asset Creation Guidelines

- **Resolution**: Target 2x the display size for high-DPI screens
- **Style**: Maintain consistent art style across all assets
- **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for gameplay visibility
- **Accessibility**: Consider color-blind friendly designs
- **Performance**: Balance quality with performance requirements
