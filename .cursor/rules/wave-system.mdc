# Wave System

The wave system controls the progression of enemy spawns throughout gameplay, as implemented in [src/game/systems/WaveSystem.ts](mdc:src/game/systems/WaveSystem.ts).

## Wave Structure

Each level consists of multiple waves of enemies, with Level 1 featuring three main waves as described in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md):

1. **Tutorial Wave** (60-120 seconds):
   - 4 goblins from the left entrance
   - Introduces basic enemy movement and tower defense

2. **Dual-Attack Wave** (150-240 seconds):
   - 5 goblins from the left entrance
   - 3 goblins from the right entrance
   - Challenges player to defend multiple paths simultaneously

3. **Final Wave with Mini-Boss** (270-360 seconds):
   - 3 goblins from the left entrance
   - 2 carriers from the right entrance
   - 1 ogre mini-boss from the least defended entrance
   - Tests player's complete defensive strategy

## Wave Configuration

Each wave is configured with:
```typescript
interface WaveConfig {
    enemies: {
        type: EnemyType;
        count: number;
        delay: number; // Delay between spawns in ms
    }[];
    breakTime: number; // Time before next wave in ms
}
```

## Wave Progression

The wave system manages:

1. **Wave Timing**:
   - Initial preparation period (~60 seconds)
   - Break times between waves (30-60 seconds)
   - Wave durations based on enemy count and type

2. **Spawn Mechanics**:
   - Enemies appear from designated spawn points
   - Spawn points correspond to predefined paths
   - Enemy selection is based on wave configuration
   - Random spawn point selection when multiple options exist

3. **Wave Completion**:
   - Tracks all active enemies in a wave
   - Detects when all enemies in a wave are defeated
   - Progresses to the next wave after the break time
   - Emits events for wave start, progress, and completion

## Between-Wave Activities

During breaks between waves:
1. Players collect resources from defeated enemies
2. Additional resource crystals/piles appear randomly
3. Players have time to reinforce defenses and repair structures
4. Messages/UI indicate the upcoming wave countdown

## Resource Economy Integration

The wave system integrates with the economy:
1. Enemies defeated in earlier waves provide resources for later waves
2. Progressive resource scaling ensures players have adequate materials for later challenges
3. Special rewards at wave completion supplement the economy

## Event Communication

The WaveSystem emits various events:
- `waveStarted`: When a new wave begins
- `waveCompleted`: When all enemies in a wave are defeated
- `allWavesCompleted`: When the final wave is cleared

## System Control Methods

Key methods for controlling the wave system:
1. `startNextWave()`: Begins the next wave in sequence
2. `checkWaveCompletion()`: Verifies if all enemies in a wave are defeated
3. `update()`: Regular updates to track enemy status
4. `isWaveInProgress()`: Checks if a wave is currently active
