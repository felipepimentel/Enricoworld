# Structure System

The structure system in the tower defense game allows players to build defensive structures to protect their base, implemented in [src/game/objects/Structure.ts](mdc:src/game/objects/Structure.ts).

## Structure Types

The game features three primary defensive structure types:

1. **Walls** (`WALL`):
   - Purpose: Block enemy movement, forcing path recalculation
   - Health: 200 (higher than other structures)
   - Cost: 30 resources
   - Special: Can be repaired by the builder
   - Upgrades: Increased health and damage resistance

2. **Towers** (`TOWER`):
   - Purpose: Attack enemies within range
   - Health: 100
   - Cost: 75 resources
   - Attack Range: 150 units
   - Attack Speed: 1 attack per second
   - Damage: 30 per hit
   - Upgrades: Increased range, damage, and attack speed

3. **Traps** (`TRAP`):
   - Purpose: Damage and slow enemies that step on them
   - Health: 80
   - Cost: 50 resources
   - Damage: 20 per activation
   - Slow Factor: Reduces enemy speed by 50%
   - Cooldown: 3 seconds between activations
   - Upgrades: Increased damage, stronger slow effect, reduced cooldown

## Structure Placement

Structures are placed by the player character (Builder):
1. Player selects structure type (keys 1-3)
2. A preview appears, following the mouse cursor
3. Player clicks to place the structure
4. Placement validity is checked (distance to builder, sufficient resources)
5. Resources are deducted upon successful placement

## Structure Lifecycle

Each structure follows this lifecycle:
1. **Building Phase**: Animation plays as structure is constructed
2. **Active Phase**: Structure performs its function (blocking, attacking, etc.)
3. **Damaged State**: Structure can take damage from enemies
4. **Repair**: Player can repair damaged structures
5. **Destruction**: Structure is removed if health reaches zero

## Upgrade System

Structures can be upgraded to increase effectiveness:
1. Level 1: Base structure
2. Level 2: Improved stats (~50% better)
3. Level 3: Maximum level (~100% better than base)

Upgrades require:
- Sufficient resources
- Builder to be in range of the structure
- Structure to be fully repaired

## Structure Behaviors

### Wall Behavior
- Blocks enemy movement
- Forces enemies to recalculate paths
- If no alternative path exists, enemies attack the wall
- High health but no offensive capabilities

### Tower Behavior
- Automatically targets nearest enemy within range
- Fires projectiles at regular intervals
- Displays range indicator when selected/hovered
- Rotates to face target enemy

### Trap Behavior
- Activates when enemy passes over it
- Deals damage and applies slowing effect
- Visual indicator shows when on cooldown
- Can affect multiple enemies simultaneously

## Structure Placement Strategy

Following the level design in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md):
1. **Critical Points**: Junctions in the H-shaped map are optimal for towers
2. **Choke Points**: Narrow corridors can be blocked with walls to redirect enemies
3. **High Traffic Areas**: Good locations for traps
4. **Entry Protection**: Prioritize defenses near spawn points

## Integration with Other Systems

The structure system integrates with:
1. **Builder System**: For placement, upgrades, and repairs
2. **Economy System**: For resource costs and management
3. **Enemy System**: For targeting, damage calculation, and path blocking
4. **Wave System**: For strategic placement between waves
