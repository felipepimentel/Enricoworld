# Enemy System

The enemy system controls the behavior of adversaries in the tower defense game, following the design outlined in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md).

## Enemy Types

The game features three main enemy types, implemented in [src/game/objects/Enemy.ts](mdc:src/game/objects/Enemy.ts):

1. **Goblins** (`GOBLIN`):
   - Basic enemies with balanced stats
   - Speed: 2 units/second (~100 in Phaser units)
   - HP: 50
   - Damage to base: 10
   - Reward: 5 resources

2. **Carriers** (`CARRIER`):
   - Medium enemies that move slightly slower but have more health
   - Speed: 1.6 units/second (~80 in Phaser units)
   - HP: 100
   - Damage to base: 15
   - Reward: 15 resources

3. **Ogre** (`OGRE`):
   - Mini-boss enemy that targets defensive structures
   - Speed: 1 unit/second (~50 in Phaser units) 
   - HP: 300
   - Damage to base: 30
   - Reward: 30 resources
   - Special behavior: Focuses on destroying structures

## Movement and Pathfinding

Enemies follow paths to reach the base:

1. They always take the shortest available path to the base
2. When blocked by walls, they will:
   - Try to find an alternative path
   - Attack the wall if no alternative exists

## Path Following Implementation

The path following system:
1. Uses Phaser's curves and paths
2. Calculates path length and duration based on enemy speed
3. Creates tweens to move enemies along the path
4. Handles direction changes to flip sprites correctly
5. Supports custom path handling for different map layouts

## Health and Damage System

Enemies have health bars and take damage from:
1. Tower attacks
2. Trap effects

When an enemy's health reaches zero:
1. The enemy dies and drops resources
2. A death animation plays
3. Rewards are emitted via events for collection

## Slowing and Status Effects

Enemies can be affected by traps and special abilities:
1. Movement speed can be reduced by a factor
2. Visual indicators show when an enemy is affected
3. Effects expire after a set duration

## Wave Integration

The enemy system integrates with the wave system to:
1. Spawn enemies at designated points
2. Track active enemies during waves
3. Detect when all enemies are defeated to advance waves

## Enemy Behavior in Level 1

Following the level design in [docs/campaign/level-1.md](mdc:docs/campaign/level-1.md):

1. **First Wave**: 4 goblins from the left entrance
2. **Second Wave**: 5 goblins from left, 3 from right (simultaneous)
3. **Final Wave**: 
   - 3 goblins from left
   - 2 carriers from right
   - 1 ogre from the least defended entrance

The ogre specifically targets defensive structures and requires multiple towers or constant repairs to defeat.
